ChatGPT Conversation Downloader is a Firefox* extension to help you save your interesting conversation with ChatGPT as a Markdown (.md) file.

*Should work on multiple browsers but mainly tested on Firefox by me, also not publised officially for other browsers at the moment.

## Usage

Install the extension and it should add a download button to the nav menu on the left side (see screenshot). Click this and a file will be downloaded in the format "chatgpt_conversation_{datetime}.md".

If the **SHIFT** key is pressed while clicking, the content will be copied to the clipboard instead.

Sample of the conversation as Markdown:

```
### You
Can you tell me a joke?

### ChatGPT

Sure, here's one: Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems.

### You
Can you explain that joke?

### ChatGPT

The joke is based on a play on words. "Why was the math book sad?" is a question that is asking for a reason why the math book might be feeling sad. The answer is "Because it had too many problems," which is a reference to the fact that math books often include a large number of problems for students to solve. The word "problems" can refer to both the mathematical problems found in a math book, and to things that cause sadness or difficulties. So, the joke is saying that the math book is sad because it has a lot of things (i.e., mathematical problems) that are difficult or challenging.
```

This extension defines two shortcuts that can be changed / removed in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox). The default values are
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> for downloading the conversation and
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> for copying the conversation to the clipboard.
